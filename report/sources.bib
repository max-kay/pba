  abstract = {Electrochemical energy conversion with efficient catalyst systems can be utilized for the production of clean and sustainable energy. Extensive studies have been carried out in last two decades to replace state-of-the-art noble metal catalysts by efficient transition metal based materials. Transition metal salts, organometallic compounds, metal organic frameworks (MOFs), polyoxometallates (POMs) etc. have been explored as the precursors for the materials synthesis. In this respect, Prussian blue (PB) and Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) attain special interest as the precursors of the materials due to their facile, robust and cost effective synthesis, highly porous structure and designed morphology. Moreover, PBAs can be prepared with multi-metal system, core-shell and hollow structure. A series of materials have been synthesized by employing PB or PBA with tailorable properties like exposed facets, porous structure, high electrochemical surface area, improved electron transport and accessible catalytic sites. These materials are found to produce excellent electrochemical activity for oxygen evolution, hydrogen evolution, oxygen reduction as well as overall water splitting. In this review, we have focused on the recent progress in PB and PBA derived materials describing their synthesis, diverse architecture, morphology and enhanced electrochemical performances. The major achievements and challenges related to PB and PBA derived materials for the energy conversion have been discussed with the direction of possible future advancement.}

              Prussian blue analogs have significant promise as active materials for the next generation of battery electrodes with improved cycle life and rate capability. Their useful electrochemical properties include two independent redox centers per unit cell; a nanoporous, open framework for rapid ion conduction; high stability during ion (de)insertion; and structural and electrochemical tunability for diverse applications. Here we share insights into how control of the five main crystallographic features (two transition-metal ions, the inserting ion, defects, and water) imparts control over the ion-insertion reaction. We then identify five key opportunities to expand our understanding of these materials, including the role of water in their ion conduction, modeling, synthesis methods, use as anode materials, and technoeconomics. Further research in these areas will accelerate the development of new, high-performing battery electrodes.}

  abstract = {Summary
              Non-lithium energy storage devices, especially sodium ion batteries, are drawing attention due to insufficient and uneven distribution of lithium resources. Prussian blue and its analogs (Prussian blue analogs [PBAs]), or hexacyanoferrates, are well-known since the 18th century and have been used for hydrogen storage, cancer therapy, biosensing, seawater desalination, and sewage treatment. Owing to their unique features, PBAs are receiving increasing interest in the field of energy storage, such as their high theoretical specific capacity, ease of synthesis, as well as low cost. In this review, a general summary and evaluation of the applications of PBAs for rechargeable batteries are given. After a brief review of the history of PBAs, their crystal structure, nomenclature, synthesis, and working principle in rechargeable batteries are discussed. Then, previous works classified based on the combination of insertion cations and transition metals are analyzed comprehensively. The review includes an outlook toward the further development of PBAs in electrochemical energy storage.}
