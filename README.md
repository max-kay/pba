# Vacancy position in Prussian blue analogues

This repository contains the code for my semesters project.

The rust code is a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the distributions of vacancies in a Prussian blue analogues.

The python scripts contain code for data analysis, working with `gemmi sfcalc` and the `Yell` format.

For all code to work there should be an `out` directory containing the subdirectories `h5`, `hk0`, `mmcif` and `models`.

Typst was used for the report and the presentation slides.
