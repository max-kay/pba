# Vacancy position in Prussian blue analogues

This repository contains the code for my semesters project.
The rust code is a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the position of vacancies in a Prussian blue analogues.
The python scripts are used for data analysis.

For all code to work there should be an `out` directory containg the directories `h5`, `hk0`, `mmcif` and `models`.
